# CS 340 Project Two: Dashboard and CRUD Module Reflection

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To keep code maintainable and easy to read, I try to make sure each function just does one thing, use clear names, and comment enough to understand what’s going on later. For the CRUD Python module in Project One, it helped a lot because I could just import it in Project Two and reuse everything without having to rewrite anything. It saved time and made things simpler when connecting the dashboard to the MongoDB database. I could definitely use that module again in other projects if I need to pull or update data in a Mongo database. I could just change the collection or query inside it and it would work for a different app.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I usually break a problem down into small steps and start with what I know how to do first, then figure out the hard parts as I go. With the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by getting the database working with the CRUD module first, then built the dashboard around it. Compared to other courses, this project felt more real because it had client-style requirements and I had to make it actually functional, not just turn in code that works for a grade. In the future, I’d make sure to ask more questions up front to get all the details about what a client needs from their database, and I’d probably sketch out a basic plan first before jumping into the code.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists build tools that make it easier for people or businesses to get stuff done or solve problems. In this case, the dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare quickly find the rescue dogs that meet specific criteria, so it saves them time and makes their process more efficient. Without a tool like that, they’d probably be looking through spreadsheets or emails or something, which would take way longer. So building software like this really helps organizations work faster and make better decisions.
